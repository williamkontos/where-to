**WhereTo?** is a fun, easy, and fair way to take the headache out of large food orders for company meals and the like. This app was built with the Operations Manager, Party Planner, and Production Assistant type positions in mind. 

_Admin process_

+ An admin can sign in and create a poll from a list of restaurants in the area.

+ While users are voting, the admin is sent to a buffer page until the polls are closed (90 seconds).

+ When the polls close and the users have ordered the meal they want from the winning restaurant, the admin will be redirected to an order summary page where they can see the info of the venue, who ordered what, as well as an itemized list and count of the orders.

_Voter process_

+ A user can sign in and see the most recent open poll created by the admin. 

+ They can then vote on the restaurant. After the votes are counted and a winner is declared, they are givin a list of three items on the winning venue's menu from which they can choose.

+ Their order is then included in the order summary for the admin.
